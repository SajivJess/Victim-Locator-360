#Victim Locator 360 (VL360) - AI-Powered Search and Rescue System

Victim Locator 360 (VL360) is an AI-driven disaster response system designed to enhance body detection in Collapsed Structure Search and Rescue (CSSR) operations. Developed for National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams, VL360 integrates autonomous drones, rovers, and machine learning (ML) models to accurately locate victims in disaster-stricken areas.

Key Features:
AI-Powered Victim Detection: Uses deep learning models to analyze GPR radargrams and real-time sensor data.
Multi-Unit Search System: Drones for aerial scanning, rovers for ground search, and GPR for sub-surface detection.
Real-Time Communication & Data Sharing: Leverages WiFi, LoRa, and secure data encryption for seamless NDRF coordination.
Autonomous Search & Rescue (SAR-V): Enables fully automated victim localization in landslides, earthquakes, and collapsed buildings.
Operational Feasibility: Designed to function in rugged terrains, extreme weather conditions, and disaster zones with minimal human intervention.
Technology Stack:
Deep Learning (CNN-based detection models)
Synthetic dataset generation via gprMax simulations
PCB-Based Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) for buried victim detection
Real-time GPS tracking & live camera feed for mission control
LoRa & WiFi-based local communication for offline operations
Edge Computing for faster data processing in remote environments
Impact & Deployment:
VL360 aims to reduce response time, increase survivor detection rates, and enhance NDRFâ€™s operational efficiency. It is designed for scalability and integration into existing SAR frameworks, making disaster relief efforts more effective and data-driven.
