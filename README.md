*🚀 Victim Locator 360 (VL360) - AI-Powered Search & Rescue System 🆘*

Victim Locator 360 (VL360) is an AI-driven disaster response system designed to enhance body detection in Collapsed Structure Search and Rescue (CSSR) operations. Developed for 🏢 National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams, VL360 integrates 🤖 autonomous drones, 🚜 rovers, and 🧠 machine learning (ML) models to accurately locate victims in disaster-stricken areas.

🔑 Key Features:

✅ AI-Powered Victim Detection – Uses 🧠 deep learning models to analyze 📡 GPR radargrams and real-time sensor data.
✅ Multi-Unit Search System – 🚁 Drones for aerial scanning, 🚜 rovers for ground search, and 📡 GPR for sub-surface detection.
✅ Real-Time Communication & Data Sharing – Uses 📶 WiFi, 📡 LoRa, and 🔐 secure encryption for seamless NDRF coordination.
✅ Autonomous Search & Rescue (SAR-V) – Enables fully automated victim localization in 🌪️ landslides, 🌍 earthquakes, and 🏚️ collapsed buildings.
✅ Rugged & Weather-Resistant – Designed to function in 🌦️ extreme conditions with minimal human intervention.

🛠 Technology Stack:
🚀 Deep Learning (CNN-based detection models)
💾 Synthetic dataset generation via gprMax simulations
📡 PCB-Based Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) for buried victim detection
📍 Real-time GPS tracking & live camera feed for mission control
📶 LoRa & WiFi-based local communication for offline operations
⚡ Edge Computing for faster data processing in remote environments

🎯 Impact & Deployment:
VL360 reduces response time, increases survivor detection rates, and enhances NDRF’s operational efficiency. Designed for scalability and easy integration into existing SAR frameworks, it makes disaster relief efforts faster, smarter, and more data-driven. 🚑📡
